# NaniKani

Hide quiz statistics on WaniKani and focus purely on learning — just you and the kanji 🌸

## About

We've all been there. You're supposed to be learning kanji, but instead you're staring at that percentage going "okay, 73%... if I get the next 5 right, I'll be at 78%..."

NaniKani hides all those distracting numbers so you can actually focus on what matters 〜
