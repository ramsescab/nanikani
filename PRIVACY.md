# Privacy Policy for NaniKani Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: January 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how the NaniKani Chrome extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection
NaniKani **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data. 
- We do not gather information that can identify you (name, email, etc.).
- We do not use cookies or tracking pixels.
- We do not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics).

## 2. Data Usage
The extension functions purely as a user-interface modification tool. 
- All code runs locally in your browser.
- The extension only modifies the visual layout (CSS) of `wanikani.com` to hide specific statistics elements as requested by the user.

## 3. Permissions
NaniKani requests specific permissions for the following reasons:
- **Host Permissions (wanikani.com):** Required solely to identify the correct pages to apply the visual changes. No data from these pages is read or saved.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing
Because we do not collect any data, no data is ever shared with, sold to, or transferred to third parties.

## 5. Security
Since the extension does not transmit any data over the internet, your browsing data remains entirely on your local machine.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions regarding this policy, please open an issue on the [NaniKani GitHub repository](https://github.com/ramsescab/nanikani).
